This is a project completed for the Networking and Security class of Landmark College.

It is a graphical peer-to-peer file transfer system using OpenSSL for encryption. It allows users to drag a file into the GUI, and send them to a given IP address. The message is symmetrically encrypted with AES, and the session key is asymmetrically encrypted using RSA.

Dependencies are gtk and openssl

Once the dependencies are installed, simply use the makefile for compilation
